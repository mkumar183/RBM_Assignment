# Restricted-Boltzmann-Machine-based-topic-modelling
This projects builds a Restricted Boltzmann Machine based model to do topic modelling on a set of textual documents.

# About RBMs
A restricted Boltzmann Machine is an "Energy Based" generative stochastic model. They were initially invented by Paul Smolensky in 1986 and were called "Harmonium". After the evolution of training algorithms in the mid 2000's by Geoffrey Hinton, the boltzman machine became more prominent. They gained big popularity in recent years in the context of the Netflix Prize where RBMs achieved state of the art performance in collaborative filtering and have beaten most of the competition.
RBM's are useful for dimensionality reduction, classification, regression, collaborative filtering, feature learning and topic modeling.
In this project, we use RBMs for topic modelling.
